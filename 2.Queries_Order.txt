1. Count the customers with grades above Bangaloreâ€™s average:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Above_Avg_Grades_Customers
FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE Grade > (SELECT AVG(Grade) FROM CUSTOMER WHERE City = 'Bangalore');



2. Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer:

SELECT S.Name, S.Salesman_id
FROM SALESMAN S
JOIN CUSTOMER C ON S.Salesman_id = C.Salesman_id
GROUP BY S.Salesman_id, S.Name
HAVING COUNT(C.Customer_id) > 1;



3. List all the salesmen and indicate those who have and do not have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation):

SELECT S.Salesman_id, S.Name, 'Has Customers' AS Status
FROM SALESMAN S
WHERE S.Salesman_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT Salesman_id FROM CUSTOMER)

UNION

SELECT S.Salesman_id, S.Name, 'No Customers' AS Status
FROM SALESMAN S
WHERE S.Salesman_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Salesman_id FROM CUSTOMER);



4. Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day:

CREATE VIEW MaxOrderSalesmanView AS
SELECT O.Salesman_id, MAX(O.Purchase_Amt) AS Max_Purchase_Amt
FROM ORDERS O
GROUP BY O.Salesman_id;



5. Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing the salesman with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted:

SET @deletedSalesmanId = 1000;

-- Delete from ORDERS table
DELETE FROM ORDERS WHERE Salesman_id = @deletedSalesmanId;

-- Finally, delete from SALESMAN table
DELETE FROM SALESMAN WHERE Salesman_id = @deletedSalesmanId;
